## This is a Learning Task

# I have to learn how to deploy a ML model using FastAPI 

Tasks Completed :
1. Understand How to deploy apps using FastAPI
2. Created an Image Classification Model
3. ReTraining the Model as it was making many incorrect predictions even while having High Accuracy.
4. Created main.py - This file contains the API -- It loads the maodel, takes input from user and gives prediction as output.



# Issues
1. Model although having good Accuracy makes incorrect Predictions


# Solution
1. Making changes in the Model Architecture
2. Make Changes in PreProcessing Steps (Like Image Size)
3. Make changes in Training Proce (Do more Aggressive Data Augmentation, no.of Epochs, Early Stopping)
